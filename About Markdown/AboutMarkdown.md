# About Markdown
> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats using a tool by the same name.——[Wiki](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

There are some off-line Markdown editors I want to introduce:

### Learning Markdown writing rules

```
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6
```
The Effect like this:
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6

*Italics*:`*Italics*`or `_Italics_`

**Bold**:`**Bold**` or `__Bold__`


> Quote:`> Quote`

* Point:`* Point`

```
1. first
2. second
3. third
```

The Effect like this:

1. first
2. second
3. third

    You can make 4 blanks front of the paragraph to show this.

All the cut-off rules:
```
* * *
***
*****
- - -
---
```

`[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.`
Effect:This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link.

If you want to insert the code in one line, you can use this **`** to **`**.
Effect:`code`

If it is a code block, you can use **```** to **```**. Every **```** take one line.

When you get to the next line, you have better leave one blank line. Or it maybe cause some format mistakes.
